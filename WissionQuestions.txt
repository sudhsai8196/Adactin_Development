Manual Testing
Bookmyshow app
● Think about parallel booking
●  scenario, told whoever logins first will be able to book first. - whoever selects the seat first.

Given a flow to create a ticket in the system and asked different api methods involved
o	during the journey. explain the method properly.
o	What would be Http Status codes.
o	Explain what type of validation needs to be performed with api. (like Authentication, Schema validation)

Search product API if no results available
1.	Api authtencation types
2.	Diff between authentication and authorization
3.	Add item to cart - what kind of api and placing an order what kind of api
4.	Selenium why create driver object with webdriver instance ?

o	Debug browser console.

Overall: Focus on Java basics, Collections, Java program, Selenium scenario, API scenarios Functional and debugging skills


Debugging capabilities – 

● Be aware of frontend and backend. Debug exp on browser console.
